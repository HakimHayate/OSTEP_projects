I'm currently reading OSTEP book and 1 of the projects recommended by the author is to create a mini shell (called wish), so I decided to make one myself to help me understand better how shell actually works.

21/06/25: Start DAY
->  Just added 1 command (ls cmd) to get started. Not bad for a start.
23/06: 
-> Added the possibility to run programs specified on the search path with arguments
-> Fixed some bugs 
24/06:
-> Add parallel commands.
