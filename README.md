I'm currently reading OSTEP book and 1 of the projects recommended by the author is to create a mini shell (called wish), so I decided to make one myself to help me understand better how shell actually works, and how to manage multiple processes.

(START DAY) 21/06/25: Just added 1 command (ls cmd) to get started. Not bad for a start.
23/06: Add the possibility to run programs specified on the search path with arguments and fixed some bugs 
24/06: Add parallel commands.
25/06: Fixed some bugs and some memory leaks. I'll add bash mode tomorrow

I took a break to study other stuff
02/07/2025: Reorganizing the code to look better, and adding functions to make the code more reeadable.
