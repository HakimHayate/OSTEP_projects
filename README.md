I put here some projects in C that I've done or I'll do that are recommended in OSTEP.

Finished projects:
-> Simple Unix commands
-> Mini-shell (a simple shell)
-> pzip (a multi-threaded program that uses RLE to compress a file)

Projects to do:
-> Build a version of a linked list that uses hand-over-hand locking (ref: https://people.csail.mit.edu/shanir/publications/concurrent-data-structures.pdf)
-> Build a B-tree or/and a hash tables that uses locking.
