I'm currently reading the OSTEP book, and one of the projects recommended by the authors is to implement a minimal shell (called wish). 
I decided to build one myself to better understand how a shell works and how to manage multiple processes.

START DAY – 21/06/25: Just added one command (ls) to get started. Not bad for a beginning.
23/06: Added support for running programs specified in the search path with arguments, and fixed some bugs.
24/06: Added support for parallel command execution.
25/06: Fixed some bugs and memory leaks. Planning to add bash mode tomorrow.

Took a break to study other topics.

02/07/25: Started reorganizing the code for better structure and added functions to improve readability.
03–04/07/25: Continued fixing bugs and further reorganizing the code.
END
